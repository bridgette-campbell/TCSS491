		The objective is for the violet ball to tag each non-chaser ball until there are no more left. <br/>
		A non-chaser ball can be purple, white, or blue. <br/>
		When a purple ball is hit it becomes white. When a white ball is hit it becomes blue. When a blue ball is hit, it is out. <br/>
		When a ball is out, it increments the caught counter and removes the ball from the field. <br/>
		Before it is removed, it has a chance to spawn two more balls.<br/>
		When the number of caught balls reaches the total number of non-chaser balls, the simulation is over. <br/>
		The green ball(s) give a velocity boost to any ball they come in contact with, chaser or not. <br/>
		They are not part of the chaser ball's objective.</p>
