		The objective is for the violet ball to tag each non-violet ball until there are no more left. <br/>
		A non-chaser ball can be purple, white, or blue. <br/>
		When a purple ball is hit it becomes white. When a white ball is hit it becomes blue. When a blue ball is hit, it is out. <br/>
		When a ball is out, it increments the Out counter and removes the ball from the field. <br/>
		When the number of Out balls reaches the number of non-chaser balls, the simulation is over.</p>
